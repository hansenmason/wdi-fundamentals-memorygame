	<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
<p>What's great about this game is I have no idea how it works. It makes it interesting. When nobody has any idea what's going on, there becomes a game within a game. What is this game we're playing, or what is a going on, is a fun g2 within the g1 of Concentration. One may call the g2 a child element of g1, but maybe that is a misfire. I'm getting offtopic. Anyway, check it out.</p>
